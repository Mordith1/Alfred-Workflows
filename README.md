# Alfred-Workflows

The purpose of this workflow is to allow directly opening google docs in Chrome,
even when Chrome isn't set to the default browser.  I tried a couple different 
browser proxies (i.e. Choose, etc.) but none seemed to work well.  

Note that this requires you have Google Drive installed on your Mac since it is
searching in the Google Drive folder (app name is "Backup and Sync from Google"). 

If you store .gdocs, .gsheets, or .gslides anywhere else on your hardrive, you
should broaden the search criteria.
